# BuildingQOLs
This mod adds a couple of optionable QOL features related to building of belts and sorters (maybe smth else later).
*I am not a professional developer so might be bugs, however i played a bit with this mod enabled and all was fine. If anything will be bad you can report via github issues, not sure i'll fix them but i'll try to*
### Whats the options?
1. **1 click belt/sorter building.** Default behaviour is click #1 - mark for building start point, drag mouse, click #2 - build. Mod adds another one: hold - mark, drag mouse, release - build. So you can *click - drag - click* or *hold - drag - release* to build a belt/sorter.
2. **Disable belt prolongation.** Default belt building behaviour includes continuous belt building if you build it into nothing. End of the belt becomes a new start and you can left click for new end or right click to cancel. There is an option to disable that. Idea is to click-drag-release, click-drag-release, similar to factorio.
3. **Show current altitude.** There is an option to replace default tip near cursor (*Choose starting position* and *Click to build*) with *"Altitude: n/ Length: m"* or *"A: n | L: m"* *(enable short ver in config)* so you will always see your current belt altitude.
4. **Auto take belt altitude.** Starting a belt in another belt on any altitude changes your current altitude to that belt's altitude.
## Config
Every option is optional so you can enable/disable any in Config after first game launch with mod enabled. Everything is enabled by default except *Short version of altitude*.
